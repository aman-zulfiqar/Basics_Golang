ðŸ“˜ Golang Practice Programs
This repository includes a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate Go (Golang) programs designed to strengthen understanding of core language concepts. The code files are well-commented and demonstrate real-world use cases using structured and idiomatic Go.

ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered
âœ… Arrays and Slices
Declaration and initialization of arrays and slices

Array limitations and slice flexibility

Using append(), make(), slicing, sorting, and deletion

Looping over arrays and slices using for and range

âœ… Maps in Go
Creating maps with make

Assigning key-value pairs

Iterating through maps

Searching for keys with ok idiom

Practical example: storing and retrieving transaction data using a hash ID

âœ… Functions and Multiple Return Values
Creating custom functions

Functions returning multiple values

Error handling using error type

Use-case example: division function with error check for divide-by-zero

âœ… Control Structures and Looping
Using if, else, and for loops effectively

User input handling with fmt.Scan

Separating and printing even and odd values from input data

âœ… Structs and User Interaction
Defining and using structs (e.g., Book)

Collecting and storing data from users

Searching through structured data (books) using user-defined criteria (like genre)

âœ… Standard Libraries Used
fmt for I/O operations

sort for sorting slices

bufio and os for buffered input

strings for string manipulation
